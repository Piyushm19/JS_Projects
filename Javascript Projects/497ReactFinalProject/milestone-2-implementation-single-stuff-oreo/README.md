## About GuzzleGram ##
The full application is a new social media, specifically designed to share alcoholic beverage recipes. In our application domain, users can make an account so they can create posts and interact with others' posts. Posts are recipes for alcoholic (or nonalcoholic, if they choose) beverages that include ingredients, instructions, and a description. 
Users can like (or unlike) posts, comments, and users. If a user enjoys a post, they have the option to favorite (or unfavorite) a post. 
The full application would be similar to an Instagram designed to share alcoholic beverage recipes. The purpose of the application is to have users connect via their consumption of alcohol and find fun, new recipes to spice up their lives. 
Just discovered a delicious combination of ingredients? Post it to GuzzleGram for the world to enjoy!
